# some basic notes

## packages and directories
the kotlin classes/files can declare there own package statement and it does not have to match the directory
structure.  In my examples so far I do not declare a package.  you can import classes and functions directly.

packages are declared at the file level, so I think all contents of a file inherit the package definition for the file
